Simple install procedure
========================

  $ tar xfz libuca-0.x.tar.gz
  $ cd libuca-0.x
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build/
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

  [ Become root if necessary ]
  $ make install


Requirements
============

libuca requires CMake and pkg-config for building libraries and accompanying
tools. Information about CMake can be found at:

    http://www.cmake.org

and pkg-config at:

    http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig

libuca depends on the GObject library for object oriented programming.
Information about this library can be found at:

    http://developers.gnome.org/gobject/stable

Each specific camera needs a camera SDK and/or a driver:

    - UFO camera: pcilib
    - pco.edge, pco.4000, pco.dimax cameras: SiliconSoftware menable IV driver
      and SDK as well as the libpco wrapper.

The control tools require Gtk+ GUI toolkit. Information is available at:

    http://developer.gnome.org/platform-overview/


Building the Library
====================

On Linux, libuca uses the CMake build system and pkg-config for dependency
detection. The normal procedure to build this library is to create an empty
build directory:

    $ mkdir build/ && cd build

configure the project using CMake:

    $ cmake ../

and compiling the library with make:

    $ make
    $ make install

Options to the build process can be passed to the system when configuring:

    $ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

or via configuration tools like `ccmake`.
