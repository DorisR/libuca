Changes in libuca 0.6.0
=======================

GObject Type System
-------------------

Instead of using a home-grown type and class system, we switched to the GObject
system as part of GLib. This effort has the advantage of much more typesafe
properties and better signal and closure handling.

Most of the ideas and approaches of libuca 0.5 have been transfered. However,
instead of trying to initialize each camera first and having the user decide
what to use, the user must now determine the used camera at compile time or use
the factory pattern to delegate this to run-time. 


Tango Wrapper
-------------

The old Tango wrapper has been superseded by a generic one that proxies
GObject's to the Tango bus. This makes things a lot easier, for example reacting
on remote property setting and more robust type safety.

The wrapper is developed as an external project at ISS by Volker Kaiser.
